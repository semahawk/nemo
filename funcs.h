/*
 * The first parameter is Naob pointer which stores all the arguments.
 *
 * The second parameter is an array of bools which indicate which options
 * are set and which are not.
 *
 * Given an example function initialized as:
 *
 *     { "foobar", foobar, 1, { OT_ANY }, "baz" }
 *
 * we can clearly see that the function "foobar" supports the three
 * options: 'b', 'a' and 'z'. The order here is significant!
 *
 * If this function "foobar" was called like this:
 *
 *     foobar -za "argument";
 *
 * then the appropriate elements in the bool array would be set to true, so,
 * finally, the "opts" argument would look like:
 *
 *     { false, true, true }
 *
 *
 * Then in the function's definition, to test if for example the
 * option 'a' was set, one would write:
 *
 *     if (opts[1]){
 *       // the 'a' option is set
 *     }
