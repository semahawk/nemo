# Nemo

# About

Nemo is a programming language written entirely in C.
Nemo is a interpreted (or compiled to bytecode), scripting language, dynamically and weakly typed.

# Installing

In order to install Nemo, you'd have to download the sources (for example by
[clicking me](http://github.com/semahawk/nemo/tarball/master)) and then you'd
have to run:

    make

to compile the sources, and then

    make install

to install it (you probably would need super user to do it).

__Note:__ at the moment Nemo is installed in `/usr/local`, that will be
customizable when we have that configure scripts.

# Dependencies

+ gcc (`4.5.4`)
+ make (`3.82`)

Most distributions should have those out of the box, but still.

Nemo has been tested, and ran multiple number of times, using these versions,
and it is confirmed that they work. Older versions may be working, but on my
computer I have only those.

# Language

Nemo is a WIP.
